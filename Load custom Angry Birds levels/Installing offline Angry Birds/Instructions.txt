- You will have a provided folder named "Application Cache".
- Close all your Chrome windows and kill all the background Chrome processes.
- Set the file system so that it shows all hidden files.
- Go to the directory
	For Windows: C:\\Users\$your_user_profile$\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default
	For Linux: /home/$your_user_profile$/.config/google-chrome/Profile 1/
	For Mac: /Users/$your_user_profile$/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default
- You will see a folder named "Application Cache" (if you don't see it just skip the first part of the next step)
- Change the name of that folder (to anything you can remember), and copy the one provided into the directory
- Restart Chrome and access the game as before

If this works for you, we recommend you do not update Chrome until the end of the competition. 

You may have to copy the provided application cache folder into the directory every time before you start the game.
